<h1>Arthur Held</h1>
<p>Retired guy futzing at stuff for fun. Currently learning webdevelopment.
   My current goal is to write a two-tab form that
 accepts pasted music track info and converts it to a .cue file for copying.</p>
 <h2>Other hobbies include</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>woodworking</li>
   <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Bk_T_ZuHHOt934gSOVXkU_2Q8xJnZ5Fe">🎞photography📸</a></li>
   <li>writing</li>
 </ul>
 <ol type="A">
   <li>item one</li>
   <li>item two</li>
 </ol>

 </o>
<p>I also enjoy cooking, but food sensitivities prevent me from making the
really good stuff these days.</p>
<hr style="height:12px;background-color:black">
<p>I went to college (Carleton) and attended a bit of graduate school (U of A)
but spent most of my life working. I started 3 businesses that all failed,
but managed to make enough working for other people to send two kids to college
and retire.</p>
